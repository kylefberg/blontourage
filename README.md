## Intro

Blontourage is a country folk band that is up and coming in the country scene here in CA.    

Blontourage needed a website that showcased their talents and beauty. I endevered to create a site that could showcase their new ep called Californa Country as well as give them a place to also sell merchindise.

###TECHNOLOGIES

The app is designed with HTML, CSS, SCSS, Bootstrap and Materalize, where the page layout and styling take place. I developed the backend and database using a MEAN stack as well as connecting to Bands In Town's API for concert information.  

I pushed the app to GitHub so that my progress could be tracked and each step would be saved.    

I then deployed to Heroku so the rest of the world could enjoy this awesome app and discover and awesome band.  

###DESIGN

My app started with a several meetings with the girls from the band and establishing a vision of what they hoped to see at the end of the project. We developed several wire frames to get an idea of what the final project would
look like. I then developed an ERD so I would be able to plan out the structure of the app.    
  
I then wrote over two dozen user stories mapping out the process I planned on using along with breaking each step into bite sized pieces. [Trello Link](https://trello.com/b/dab6lDJj/blontourage) I organized action items so I could track the flow of a user experience. This helped me 
organize each step and also served as a reminder to push to GitHub often.

###NEXT STEPS

In my icebox I have several ideas to improve the existing app. Some of those ideas include connecting to the API's of FaceBook, Instagram and Twitter to show live feeds on the site and better help the band to build their social media platform.
